AI Code Loop Design and develop an e-commerce shopping cart module for me. boilerplating + Source code Ask a question: What is the easiest way this can go wrong? Money can be stolen → Typing is cheap now, thinking is expensive I’m not going to start or build the whole app. I will break the big task into small parts, and I will guide AI like a real Engineer. Do 3 things correctly: 1. Define the problem clearly 2. Break it into small pieces 3. Prove the result is correct The AI Code Loop: Think → Ask → Refine → Validate → Repeat Example Time Requirement Note: We need a cart total calculator on the server. User sends cart items and quantity. We must validate user input first. We must handle unknown products and invalid quantities. We must calculate subtotal, discount, VAT, and final total. We must ensure money correctness. We must write tests. Modified Prompt: Create a Node.js cart calculator with tests Goal: Build a cart calculation service. Rules: Validate input strictly Reject invalid product IDs Reject negative or zero quantities Use integer math for money (cents) Calculate subtotal, VAT, discount, final total Return clear error messages Input: Cart items array (productId, quantity) Output: Subtotal VAT Discount Final total Prompt → Engineering: We took a big problem and broke it into a small piece We wrote rules so the AI doesn’t guess We asked for tests so we can prove it We ran the tests so we can trust it Same loop, different depth: Beginner – one small function + tests Mid level – more rules and edge cases Senior – business rules, security, performance Architect – scale, money safety, audits Reusable Prompt Template: Context: You are a senior software engineer Goal: Build a small, correct, testable feature Rules: Validate all inputs Handle edge cases No assumptions Use best practices Deliverables: Clean code Tests Clear explanation Think: Break the problem down before writing code
